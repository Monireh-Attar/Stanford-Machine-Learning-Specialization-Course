# Stanford-Machine-Learning-Specialization-Course
This repository contains my solutions, notes, and project implementations from the Stanford Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera. 
The specialization, led by Professor Andrew Ng, covers foundational concepts in machine learning, including:
1. Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
2. Advanced Learning Algorithms: Neural Networks
3. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Anomaly Detection), Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
